> [11ty/Eleventy][eleventy_link] is a simpler static site generator.

Basically, it is published on [Netlify][netlify_link] via [GitHub][github_link], some of them have their own subdomain name assigned.  
And content management is done with [11ty/Eleventy][eleventy_link], other CSS, JavaScript and image builds are done with [Gulp.js][gulp_link], and these are controlled with npm run scripts.


<!--

    - Dart Sass with sourcemaps
    - Terser with sourcemaps
    - Webp conversion with lastrun
- 11ty/Eleventy
    - Nunjucks with html-minifier
- Node.js versioning assumes the use of rtx.
