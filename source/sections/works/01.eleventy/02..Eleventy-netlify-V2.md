**Something like a "blog" but not a "blog"...ブログみたいだがブログではない何か**

Because I want to manage the content in chapters rather than in chronological order, I have implemented it independently without using the 11ty/Eleventy functions.

[@dollplayer2501](https://github.com/dollplayer2501)'s 駄文置き場, build with 11ty/Eleventy, Gulp and [Solid State](https://html5up.net/solid-state) of [HTML5 UP!](https://html5up.net/)'s template and color scheme is [WordPress theme's Hexa](https://wordpress.com/ja/theme/hexa).

Site URL is <small>[https://dollplayer2501.netlify.app/](https://dollplayer2501.netlify.app/)</small> a.k.a "**unlimited text works, the 4th.**".
