> [Qtile](https://qtile.org/) is a full-featured, hackable tiling window manager written and configured in Python.

I think [tiling window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) is better than being displayed in a tile format and is great at working with [virtual desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop).  
After using [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and [Sway](https://swaywm.org/), I am currently using [Qtile](https://qtile.org/) and [Qtile Extras](https://github.com/elParaguayo/qtile-extras), but I would also like to try [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/).  
As a side effect of trying [Qtile](https://qtile.org/), I was able to customize it using Python, which I had never touched before, so I learned a lot.
