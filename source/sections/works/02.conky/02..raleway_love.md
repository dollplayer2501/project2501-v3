**I like Raleway font!**  

Overview

:   Because I like the baseline deviation of the numbers.  
:   ex. 0123456789.  
:   I wanted to feature this font with Conky theme.  
:   This is the first theme I created when I started using Conky.  
:   Unlike 'angle_minus_five_degrees' mentioned above, this one is implemented without using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)/[Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/).  
:   Since it uses the [Raleway font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway), which is a proportional font, I don't think it's suitable for real-time status display, but I wanted to use this font, so I created this theme.  
:   There are no plans to modify this theme in the future.
