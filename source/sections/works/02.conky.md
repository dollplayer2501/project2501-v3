> [Conky][conky_link] is a system monitor for X.

I started using Linux...[EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) around the fall of 2022.  
The main use is programming, which was previously done on macOS. Together with [Qtile](https://qtile.org/), a tiling window manager, I am satisfied with the usability.  
When using a new OS, I wanted to monitor the status of my PC, so I installed [Conky][conky_link].
