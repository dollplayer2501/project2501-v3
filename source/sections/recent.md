Freelance, co-worker, lives in Kako District, Hyōgo, Japan.  
I'm an IT土方・電算職<sub>（自称）</sub>, NOT ENGINEER, and not sure if I'm a programmer or not?

BTW, in the summer of 2022, I had an artificial femoral head, <sub>人工骨頭</sub>, made by [Stryker](https://www.stryker.com/), inserted into my left thigh, <sub>左大腿部</sub>.  
Regarding this operation, I go to rehabilitation twice a week, but I am secretly happy that I have become a <sub>[義体化](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%A9%E4%BD%93%E5%8C%96)</sub>, [cyborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg).

And now, three years later in 2025, I have been interested in [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) environment settings for several years.  
Specifically, the tiling window manager Qtile, Conky, Fish shell, Neovim, etc.  
As the environment is finally coming together, I have started to get interested in web development again.
